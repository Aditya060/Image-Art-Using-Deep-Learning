# Image-Art-Using-Deep-Learning

This is an implementation of the Paper A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style (https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576).

This project aims to use Neural  Style transfer to extract style from one image and  features from  another image and transfer both of them to a new image all the while trying to retain the characteristics from both the images.The resulting image has the characteristics of both the original image and the style of the feature image

(Change  number of  iterations for tuning the effect of the filter)
